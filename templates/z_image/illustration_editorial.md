A visual riddle wrapped in a beautiful image. Metaphors take physical form, turning abstract concepts into tangible reality. A brain becomes a maze; a city becomes a circuit board. It is art with a job to do—inviting the viewer to pause, decode, and smile at the wit of the solution. The style is bold, the composition clever, and the message hits with the precision of a well-crafted punchline.
