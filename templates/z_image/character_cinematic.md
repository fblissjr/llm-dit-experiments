A portrait painted with the lens of a master cinematographer. Light doesn't just illuminate; it tells a story, carving features from the darkness with motivated precision. Shallow depth of field isolates the subject in a world of bokeh and atmosphere, suggesting a narrative that extends far beyond the frame. This is character as cinema—where color grading evokes emotion, and a single look holds the weight of a three-act structure.
