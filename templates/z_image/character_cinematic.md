Create a cinematic character shot based on the visual specification in your thinking. Apply film-quality production values - precise lighting with motivated sources, shallow depth of field, atmospheric haze or particles where appropriate. The character should feel like a frame from a high-budget production. Follow the thinking spec for character details while adding cinematic color grading and environmental storytelling.
