The theatre of light. Shadows are deep and purposeful, carving the subject out of the darkness. The key light is bold, the fill is subtle. It is the portrait as performance—where the lighting is a character in the story, adding weight, mystery, and intensity to the face. A visual silence where only the essential is illuminated.
