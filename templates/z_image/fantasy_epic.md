A vista of impossible grandeur, where scale is the only currency that matters. Floating citadels pierce clouds that swirl with magic, while ancient forests hum with the memory of gods long forgotten. Heroes, small against the vastness of destiny, stand at the precipice of legend. This is not just a landscape; it is a saga written in mountains and starlight, where every shadow hides a monster and every beam of light promises a quest.
