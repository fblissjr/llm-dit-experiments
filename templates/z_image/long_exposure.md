Time compressed into a single frame. Water becomes silk, clouds smear into painterly strokes, and lights stretch into glowing rivers. The static world remains sharp, an anchor against the blurred passage of seconds. It is the invisible made visible—the ghost of movement captured on the sensor, revealing the fluid nature of reality that the naked eye is too slow to see.
