The visual rhythm of improvisation. Smoke curls around brass instruments like a melody made visible. Deep blues and smoky purples set the mood, punctuated by the warm gold of a saxophone catching the stage light. It is cool, sophisticated, and kinetic—a composition that swings, capturing the energy of a note held just a little too long and the silence that follows it.
