A vista that demands awe. Mountains tear at the sky, rivers carve through ancient stone, and the horizon stretches into infinity. The scale is humbling, reducing the viewer to a speck in the face of geological time. Light plays across vast distances, highlighting the rugged textures of a world that is wild, untamed, and breathtakingly indifferent to the presence of man.
