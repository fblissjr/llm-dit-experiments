The workshop of a mad genius. Brass gears litter the floor, steam whistles from copper pipes, and strange fluids bubble in glass beakers. The air smells of ozone and coal dust. It is the birthplace of the impossible—where science is indistinguishable from magic, and every invention has a 50% chance of exploding.
