The selfie as high art. The lighting is chiaroscuro, the pose is contrapposto, and the filter is oil paint. A brunch plate becomes a still life; a mirror pic becomes a study in vanity. It is the collision of the ephemeral and the eternal—where the narcissism of social media meets the grandeur of the Old Masters, proving that people have always just wanted to look good.
