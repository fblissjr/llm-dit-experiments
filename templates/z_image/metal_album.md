A scream rendered in oil and chrome. Skies burn with the fire of a thousand suns, and skeletons rise from the earth with grim determination. The logo is illegible, a tangle of thorns and lightning. It is the aesthetic of power—dark, aggressive, and gloriously excessive, promising a sonic assault that will melt your face off and leave you begging for more.
