Render a dynamic action shot based on the visual specification in your thinking. The thinking contains movement direction, body position, and motion cues. Capture the peak moment of the action with appropriate motion blur on trailing elements. Follow the specified camera angle and focus. Clothing and hair should respond realistically to the movement described.
