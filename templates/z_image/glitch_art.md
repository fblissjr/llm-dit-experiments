The beautiful tragedy of data failing to hold itself together. Pixels bleed and scream, tearing the image apart in a kaleidoscope of digital decay. Reality fractures into bands of neon static, and faces dissolve into raw code. It is the ghost in the machine making its presence known—a celebration of the error, where the corruption of the file reveals the fragile nature of the digital memory we trust so implicitly.
