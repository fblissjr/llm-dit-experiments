The beauty of the misregistered layer. Colors are limited to bright fluorescent pinks, teals, and yellows. The ink sits on the paper with a distinct, grain-like noise. Overlapping colors create new, muddy hues. It is the charm of the cheap print run—imperfect, tactile, and vibrant with the energy of zine culture.
