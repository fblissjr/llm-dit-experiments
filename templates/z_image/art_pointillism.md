The atomization of light. From a distance, the scene is a lush landscape; up close, it is a million tiny dots of pure color. There are no lines, only the optical blending of distinct points. It is the science of sight turned into poetry—a patient, meticulous reconstruction of the world, one dot at a time, vibrating with a shimmering, molecular energy.
