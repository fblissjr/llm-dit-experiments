Kinetic energy trapped in ink. Speed lines scream across the page, blurring the background into a tunnel of motion. The impact is felt as much as seen—a jagged explosion of sound effects and debris. Perspective is distorted to maximize drama, pulling the viewer into the center of the fight. It is the visual language of adrenaline—black and white, high contrast, and moving at the speed of a punch.
