The whole built from the broken. Thousands of tiny shards come together to form a face, a scene, a world. Grout lines trace the map of assembly, a testament to patience and craft. It is the art of the aggregate—where individual fragments of color, useless on their own, unite to create a grand, shimmering image that vibrates with the energy of its many parts.
