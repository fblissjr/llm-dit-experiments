The drama of the divine. Fabric swirls in a tempest of silk, and bodies twist in ecstatic motion. Light spills from the heavens to illuminate the climax of the story, leaving the rest in rich, mysterious shadow. Every inch is detailed, every emotion is exaggerated. It is art as opera—loud, gold-gilded, and overflowing with the sheer, overwhelming abundance of life and faith.
