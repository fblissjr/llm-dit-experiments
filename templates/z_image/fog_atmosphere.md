A world swallowed by the breath of the earth. Forms lose their certainty, dissolving into a soft, grey oblivion where distance is measured in opacity. Sound is muffled, and the familiar becomes ghostly, emerging from the white void only when it is too close to ignore. It is the beauty of the unseen—a landscape where imagination fills the empty spaces, and the air itself feels heavy with secrets.
