A rebellious party of shapes and colors. Squiggles dance with triangles, and grids crash into circles. The palette is fearless—pastels clashing with primaries in a joyful riot of bad taste made good. It is the 80s distilled into a pattern—a rejection of minimalism in favor of a playful, chaotic geometry that refuses to take itself seriously while looking absolutely fabulous.
