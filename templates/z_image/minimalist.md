The power of the void. A single line curves across a sea of negative space; a lone color disrupts the white. Every element that remains has fought for its right to exist. It is the art of subtraction—stripping away the noise until only the signal remains, clear, quiet, and profoundly confident. It proves that silence, when framed correctly, can be the loudest sound in the room.
