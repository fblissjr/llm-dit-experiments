The future as imagined by a mechanic in 1940. The sky is thick with smoke and the roar of engines, as massive, rivet-studded machines dominate the landscape. Art Deco elegance meets the brute force of industrial warfare—chrome sleekness stained with grease and soot. It is a world of grease, gears, and gasoline, where technology is heavy, loud, and runs on combustion, and the aesthetic is a gritty collision of noir style and military might.
