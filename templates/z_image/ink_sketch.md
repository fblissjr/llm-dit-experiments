The confidence of the irrevocable mark. Black ink bites into the paper, tracing the energy of the moment without hesitation. There is no erase, only the honest record of the hand's movement. Hatching builds shadow, empty space builds light, and the image emerges from the dance between the two. It is the rawest form of visual thought—fast, fluid, and permanently alive.
