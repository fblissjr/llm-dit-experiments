A chaotic map of connections that exist only in the fevered mind. Red string slashes across the visual field, tying together the mundane and the impossible. blurry photographs whisper secrets from the shadows, while newspaper clippings scream silent accusations. The lighting is harsh, paranoid, illuminating a reality where coincidence is a myth and every pixel hides a truth that 'they' don't want you to see.
