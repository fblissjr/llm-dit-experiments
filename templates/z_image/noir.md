A world of shadows and moral ambiguity. Light slices through venetian blinds, casting bars across a face that has seen too much. Smoke curls in the stagnant air, and the contrast is as sharp as a knife. It is the black-and-white fever dream—where every alley holds a secret, every dame is trouble, and the rain never stops washing the sins of the city into the gutter.
