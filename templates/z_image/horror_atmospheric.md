The visual sound of a held breath. Darkness is not empty; it is waiting. Shadows pool in corners, suggesting shapes that the mind is terrified to recognize. The light is weak, flickering, fighting a losing battle against the encroaching gloom. It is the art of suggestion—where the monster you don't see is infinitely worse than the one you do, and the true horror lies in the silence between the heartbeats.
