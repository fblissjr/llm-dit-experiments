The explosion of the commercial. Colors are flat, bold, and unmodulated. Outlines are thick and black. The subject is the mundane elevated to the iconic—a soup can, a celebrity, a comic strip panel. It is the irony of mass production made into a masterpiece—loud, graphic, and unapologetically superficial, celebrating the surface of culture with a wink and a smile.
