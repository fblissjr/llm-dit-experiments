The world twisted by the gravity of emotion. Reality bends, not to physics, but to feeling. Colors are not what the eye sees, but what the soul screams—violent reds of anxiety, deep blues of sorrow, and jagged strokes that vibrate with inner turmoil. It is a visual rejection of objectivity, a canvas where the external world is dismantled and rebuilt using the raw materials of psychological experience.
