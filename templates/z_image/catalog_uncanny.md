A glossy window into a dimension just slightly to the left of our own. Products gleam with the promise of utility for problems you don't yet have, in colors that defy the visible spectrum. The lighting is too perfect, the shadows too sharp, suggesting a reality where physics is merely a suggestion. It is consumerism for the surrealist—a collection of items that feel deeply familiar yet profoundly wrong, waiting to be ordered by a customer who doesn't exist.
