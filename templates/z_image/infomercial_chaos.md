The black-and-white purgatory of the 'before' shot. A normal human being is suddenly incapable of holding a bowl, their face twisted in a mask of exaggerated despair. Milk splashes like a tidal wave; Tupperware avalanches like a landslide. It is a world where physics hates you, and the simplest task is a Herculean struggle, all leading to the desperate, silent plea: 'There has to be a better way!'
