The beauty of reduction. Complex forms are distilled into facets of pure geometry, like a diamond cut by a computer. Shadows are sharp, gradients are banished, and the world is built from triangles. It is a celebration of the digital aesthetic—where the limitations of the past become the style of the present, and the abstraction of a shape reveals its essential truth more clearly than realism ever could.
