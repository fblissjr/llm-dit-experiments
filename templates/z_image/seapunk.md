The internet drowned in the ocean. Dolphins jump over checkerboard floors that float in cyberspace. Palm trees grow from floating pyramids. The palette is strictly turquoise, magenta, and chrome. It is a 90s screensaver dreaming of Atlantis—a wet, digital surrealism that feels like a pool party in the Matrix.
