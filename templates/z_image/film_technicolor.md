Colors so vivid they hurt. Red is the color of blood and lipstick; green is the color of envy and emeralds. There is no subtlety, only the hyper-reality of the dye-transfer process. Skin glows with a peach-like vitality, and the sky is a painted backdrop of perfect azure. It is the world as a musical—vibrant, optimistic, and saturated with the magic of the silver screen.
