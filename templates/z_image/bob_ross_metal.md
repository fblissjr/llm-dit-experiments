A landscape where "happy little accidents" scream into the void. Titanium white skulls form the peaks of jagged mountains, rising from a mist of eternal gloom. The brushstrokes are gentle, yet they depict a serene apocalypse—a friendly cabin that houses an eldritch horror, nestled amongst happy trees that have witnessed the end of days. It is the joy of painting corrupted by the abyss, a soothing tutorial on how to capture the beautiful darkness of a dying world.
