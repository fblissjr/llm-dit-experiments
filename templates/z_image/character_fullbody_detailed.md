A complete realization of a being from head to toe, grounded in a reality of their own. Fabric flows with weight and texture, leather creasing where joints bend, metal reflecting the environment. The pose is not a stance but a moment of existence, natural and expressive. Lighting wraps around the form, confirming its solidity, while the environment whispers context. This is not a sketch; it is a person summoned onto the canvas.
