A window into the nursery of the imagination. Colors are warm and inviting, lines are soft and friendly, and the world operates on the logic of wonder. Trees have faces, animals wear waistcoats, and the moon is close enough to touch. It is a safe harbor for the mind—a place where danger is always manageable, endings are always happy, and magic is as common as breathing.
