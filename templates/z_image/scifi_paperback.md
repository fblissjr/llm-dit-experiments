The dream of the stars painted in acrylic. Spacemen in bubble helmets gaze at ringed planets from the surface of alien moons. Ships are sleek and chrome, soaring over landscapes of impossible geology. It is the nostalgia for the future—a vision of space travel that is romantic, colorful, and filled with the wonder of exploration, before we knew how cold the void really was.
