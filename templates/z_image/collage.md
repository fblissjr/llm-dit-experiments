A chaotic harmony of torn edges and disparate realities. Vintage ephemera whispers to modern textures, creating a visual dialogue across time. Layers of paper, fabric, and ink overlap to build new meaning from the debris of the old. It is the art of recontextualization—where a map becomes a face, a ticket becomes a memory, and the deliberate fragmentation of the world creates a surreal, textured wholeness.
