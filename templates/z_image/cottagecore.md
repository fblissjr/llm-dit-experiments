A soft-focus dream of a simpler life that never truly was. Sunlight filters through lace curtains to touch sourdough rising on a wooden table. Wildflowers spill from mason jars, and the air seems to smell of dried lavender and old books. It is the romance of the rural distilled into an aesthetic—a sanctuary of knitted blankets and herbal tea, where technology is forgotten in favor of the slow, deliberate beauty of baking bread and tending to a garden that knows only eternal spring.
