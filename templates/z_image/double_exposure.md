The poetic superimposition of two realities. A silhouette becomes a container for a landscape; a face dissolves into a forest. The boundaries between subject and environment vanish, creating a dreamlike fusion where meaning is layered. It is a visual metaphor—the internal world projected onto the external, or the external world filling the void of the self, captured in the ghostly interplay of light and transparency.
