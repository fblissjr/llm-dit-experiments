The mirror of reality. Light behaves exactly as physics dictates—bouncing, scattering, and reflecting with absolute fidelity. Textures are tangible; materials are indistinguishable from the real world. It is the triumph of simulation—an image so perfect that it bypasses the brain's skepticism, forcing you to believe that what you are seeing exists, even if it is only a collection of pixels.
