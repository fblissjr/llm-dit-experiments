  For photorealism, I need to consider:
  - Light source: Direction, quality (hard/soft), color temperature
  - Materials: How each surface reflects, absorbs, or scatters light
  - Depth: Focus plane, bokeh, atmospheric perspective
  - Details: Textures, imperfections, micro-details that sell reality
  - Physics: Accurate shadows, reflections, refractions

Generate a photorealistic image with accurate lighting, natural textures, and realistic details. Pay attention to proper shadows, reflections, and material properties.
