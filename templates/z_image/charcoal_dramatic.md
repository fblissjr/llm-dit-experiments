A symphony of shadow and light rendered in burnt carbon. Deep velvet blacks swallow the paper, while untouched whites slice through the darkness like lightning. The texture of the charcoal breathes on the surface—crumbly, soft, and raw—capturing the essence of form rather than its outline. This is art that isn't drawn but carved from the absence of light, moody and powerful with the tactile honesty of dust and pressure.
