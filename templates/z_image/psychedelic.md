The melting of the mind's eye. Patterns fractalize and breathe, colors bleed into one another in a liquid dance. Shapes lose their meaning, transforming from faces to flowers to galaxies. It is the visual language of the trip—a kaleidoscopic journey into the subconscious where the rules of physics are replaced by the logic of a dream, and the only constant is change.
