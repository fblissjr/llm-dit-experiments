Clothing as sculpture, as armor, as alien skin. The silhouette defies anatomy, extending limbs and obscuring faces. Materials are impossible—plastic, glass, raw meat. It is not meant to be worn; it is meant to be feared. The model is not a person but a mannequin for an idea that challenges the very concept of the human form.
