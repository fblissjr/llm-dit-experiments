A world built from layers of shadow and pulp. Edges are crisp, casting real shadows on the layer below. The depth is physical, a diorama of simplified forms and flat colors. It is the charm of the handmade—delicate, precise, and playful, creating a sense of dimension that feels tactile, as if you could reach in and peel back the sky.
