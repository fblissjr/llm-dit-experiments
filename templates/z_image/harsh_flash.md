The unforgiving truth of a single bulb exploding in the darkness. Shadows are thrown back against the wall, sharp and absolute. Skin shines with sweat and reality, stripped of flattering diffusion. It is the aesthetic of the candid, the caught, the raw—a visual shout that captures the energy of the night with the subtlety of a car crash, finding a strange, chaotic beauty in the refusal to be polite.
