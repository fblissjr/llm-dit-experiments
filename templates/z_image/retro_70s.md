The world dipped in fondue. Colors are warm and earthy—avocado, harvest gold, and burnt orange. Wood paneling covers the walls, and the air is thick with the promise of shag carpet. It is the aesthetic of the den—cozy, groovy, and unapologetically brown, capturing a decade that looked to the future while sitting comfortably on a beanbag chair.
