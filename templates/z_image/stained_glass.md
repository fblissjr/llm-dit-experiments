Light made solid. Color is trapped in shards of glass, bound by lines of lead. The sun pushes through, turning the image into a glowing projection. It is the art of the window—where the story is told not by pigment, but by the filtration of light itself, creating a sacred, jewel-toned radiance that shifts with the passing of the day.
