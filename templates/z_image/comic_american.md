The mythology of the modern age rendered in bold ink and Ben-Day dots. Action explodes from the panel with exaggerated dynamism, where physics bows to the rule of cool. heavy black outlines contain colors that punch with primary intensity, while dramatic foreshortening turns every movement into an event. This is storytelling at its most graphic—a world where heroes are larger than life, shadows are absolute, and sound effects are visible.
