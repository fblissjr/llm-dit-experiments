A world screaming in Technicolor. Colors do not just exist; they vibrate, pushed to the very edge of perception. The spectrum is weaponized, assaulting the eye with a joy that borders on hysteria. It is reality on a sugar rush—a visual overdose where subtlety is a dirty word and the only rule is that if it can be brighter, it must be brighter.
