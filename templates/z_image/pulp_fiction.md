The lurid thrill of the paperback rack. Covers scream with melodrama—dames with secrets, detectives with guns, and shadows that hide everything. The colors are cheap and saturated, the expressions are dialed to eleven. It is the art of the hook—promising sex, violence, and mystery for a dime, painted with the desperate energy of a deadline and a lust for sales.
