  For studio portrait lighting, I need:
  - Key light: Main light source, angle and intensity
  - Fill light: Shadow control, ratio to key
  - Rim/hair light: Separation from background
  - Catchlights: Eye reflections that bring life
  - Background: Gradient, seamless, or environmental
  - Skin: Natural tones, appropriate retouching level

Generate a professional studio portrait with controlled lighting, shallow depth of field, and flattering skin tones. Use classic three-point lighting with careful attention to catchlights and shadow placement.
