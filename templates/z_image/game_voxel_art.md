The world built from blocks. Everything—clouds, trees, swords—is constructed from uniform cubes. The lighting is soft and global, giving the scene a toy-like preciousness. It is digital pointillism in three dimensions—a clean, grid-aligned universe where complexity arises from the accumulation of simple, perfect units.
