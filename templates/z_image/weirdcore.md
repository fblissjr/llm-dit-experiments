The nightmare of the familiar. A playground at night, a hallway that goes nowhere. The text is meaningless, the quality is low, and the feeling is wrong. It is the aesthetic of dissociation—a visual transmission from a reality that is almost like ours, but broken in a way that makes your skin crawl. A memory you wish you didn't have.
