A landscape from a hallucination. Floating islands defy gravity, interconnected by bridges of crystal and sound. The scale is impossible, the colors are from a spectrum not yet discovered, and the imagery suggests a concept so deep it requires a gatefold sleeve to explain. It is the visual equivalent of a 20-minute synthesizer solo—complex, pretentious, and undeniably majestic.
