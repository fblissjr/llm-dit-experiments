Stone reaching for heaven in a prayer of geometry. Pointed arches rise like clasped hands, and flying buttresses defy gravity with skeletal grace. Gargoyles leer from the rain gutters, watching over a world they do not understand. It is the romance of the medieval reimagined—dark, vertical, and obsessed with the sublime beauty of shadow and stone lace.
