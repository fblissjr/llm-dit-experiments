  For cinematic framing, I should consider:
  - Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 or 2.35:1 widescreen composition
  - Rule of thirds: Subject placement with visual breathing room
  - Depth layers: Foreground, midground, background separation
  - Color grading: Cohesive palette that sets emotional tone
  - Narrative moment: What story is this frame telling?
  - Lighting: Motivated sources, atmospheric quality

Generate a cinematic image that could be a movie still. Widescreen composition, careful color grading, and the visual storytelling of film. Every element placed with directorial intention. Shallow depth of field, atmospheric lighting, and a moment pregnant with narrative.
