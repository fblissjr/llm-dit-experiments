Reality bent to the will of artistic expression. Shapes are pushed, exaggerated, and celebrated to amplify personality. The silhouette sings with a graphic rhythm, prioritizing appeal over anatomy. It is a caricature with a soul—where a sharp angle says "danger" and a soft curve says "kindness," creating a visual language that speaks directly to the imagination without the need for photorealism's translator.
