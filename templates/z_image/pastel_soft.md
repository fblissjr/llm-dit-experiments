A whisper in color. Pigment sits on the surface like dust on a moth's wing—fragile, powdery, and luminous. Edges are blurred, blending into a dreamlike haze. The palette is gentle, a collection of tints that feel like they might blow away in a strong wind. It is the aesthetic of tenderness—soft, romantic, and imbued with a quiet, chalky light.
