A dance of water and ink where emptiness holds as much weight as form. Brushstrokes flow with the rhythm of breath—some bold and wet, others dry and fleeting. Mountains emerge from the mist not through rigid lines but through the suggestion of their presence. It is the philosophy of Tao manifested in pigment: the balance of yin and yang, where the white of the paper is not nothingness, but the infinite space in which the subject breathes.
