Data transfigured into flesh and bone. Structured values shed their brackets and quotes to become visual truth. Descriptions of "brave" and "tall" dissolve into the set of a jawline and the length of a shadow. This is the alchemy of interpretation—taking the cold, hard logic of a JSON object and breathing life into it, ignoring the syntax to reveal the soul hidden within the parameters. A character born from code, standing fully realized without a single line of text to bind them.
