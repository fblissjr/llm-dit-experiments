The hum of fluorescent lights in an empty room. Rows of beige cubicles stretch into a vanishing point that feels infinite. The carpet is patterned with a chaotic neutrality, and the air is stale with the memory of productivity. It is a space out of time—a purgatory of water coolers and ergonomic chairs where it is always 2:30 PM on a Tuesday, and everyone has just stepped out for a meeting that will never end.
