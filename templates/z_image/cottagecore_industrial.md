The moss reclaims the machine. Flowers bloom from the rust of a gear; vines strangle a smokestack. The soft, pastoral dream of the cottage meets the hard, cold reality of the factory. It is a post-human garden—where nature forgives industry by consuming it, turning the ruins of progress into a trellis for roses.
