The earth turning itself inside out. Rivers of molten rock carve through black fields of hardened basalt. The air shimmers with heat and sulfur. Steam vents hiss like angry snakes. It is the primal forge of the planet—a landscape of destruction and creation, where the ground is not solid, and the fire is not tame.
