A cheerful dystopia of flat colors and impossible anatomy. Faceless figures with purple skin and rubber-hose limbs frolic in a void of productivity. They high-five over floating charts, their bodies bending in ways that defy skeletal structure to fit the composition. It is the aesthetic of harmlessness—a visual language designed to be so inclusively abstract that it becomes alien, a smiling, vector-based hallucination of human cooperation.
